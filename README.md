# News Article Text Classification

This project aims to classify news articles into different categories based on their content using machine learning techniques.

# Overview:

The code in this repository comprises Python scripts for text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for news article classification. The dataset includes news articles categorized into four classes, each containing titles and descriptions.

# Usage

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, nltk, scikit-learn, spacy, wordcloud

# Results

The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 85.49% in categorizing news articles into different classes based on their content.
Visualizations included bar charts showing the distribution of articles among classes and word clouds highlighting prominent words in article descriptions.
